USING THE PACKAGE
-----------------

First of all, you should decide whether you want to work in linear or gamma space:
  * The "Sky Dome" prefab has a checkbox called "Linear Lighting"
  * This should only be checked if linear lighting is enabled for your project

  REMARK
  Linear lighting is a Unity Pro feature that can be enabled under "Edit->Project Settings->Player->Color Space"
  For more information on linear lighting visit http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/LinearLighting.html

To add the sky dome to your scene:
  * Drag the "Sky Dome" prefab into your scene
  * Set the parameters of the "Sky.cs" script component to your liking

To fit the sky dome size to your clipping plane:
  * Adjust the scale of your sky dome instance according to the clipping plane set in your camera
  * The scale in x, y and z direction should be equal

To move the sky dome to the camera position in every frame:
  * Add the script "SkyCamera.cs" to your camera
  * Drag your instance of the sky dome onto the the "Sky" property of the "SkyCamera.cs" script

  REMARK
  This script moves the sky dome directly before clipping the scene, guaranteeing that all other position updates have
  been processed. You should not move the sky dome in "LateUpdate" because this can cause minor differences in the sky
  dome position between frames when moving the camera.

To enable the dynamic day / night cycle:
  * The sky dome prefab has a script "SkyTime.cs" attached to it, but it is disabled by default
  * Enable this component by checking the according checkbox
  * Set the parameters of this script to your liking

To switch between pre-defined weather types:
  * The sky dome prefab has a script "SkyWeather.cs" attached to it, but it is disabled by default
  * Enable this component by checking the according checkbox
  * Set the parameters of this script to your liking
  * Adding your own weather types is very easy as the script is essentially just one enum and a switch statement

To use a custom skybox at night:
  * Disable the child object called "Space"
  * Setup your camera to render the skybox of your choice, it will automatically be visible at night



DESKTOP VS MOBILE
-----------------

Differences between the "Sky Dome" prefab and the "Sky Dome (Mobile)" prefab:
  * Reduced sky dome mesh vertex count on mobile
  * The parameters "Cloud Sharpness" and "Cloud Shading" are being ignored on mobile

  REMARK
  The reason for this is that "Cloud Sharpness" and "Cloud Shading" have to be applied per-pixel and are therefore
  very costly on mobile devices. However, you can achieve the same effect as the "Cloud Sharpness" parameter by
  manually editing the cloud noise texture. The package comes with three textures for three kinds of cloud coverage,
  all you have to do is set the noise texture in the cloud shader appropriately.

Depending on your project, newer mobile devices (iPhone 4S / iPad 2 or better) might be capable of rendering the
desktop version of this package. However, as there are almost no visual downgrades in the mobile version you might
be better off investing any free computation time you have into other components of your scene.



RENDERING ORDER
---------------

All components of the sky dome are being rendered after the opaque but before the transparent meshes of your scene.
That means that only areas of the sky dome that are not being occluded by any other geometry have to be rendered.

The rendering order of the sky dome components is the following:
  1. Space
  2. Moon
  3. Atmosphere
  4. Sun
  5. Clouds

This usually leads to 3-5 draw calls to render the complete sky dome. If you want to save additional draw calls
on mobile devices you can for example remove the halo material from the moon renderer.
